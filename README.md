# BSU-SC-Research-Data-Bank_Final
This is our capstone project for Capstone II, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology

Bulacan State University - Sarmiento Campus Research Data Bank (BSU-SC Research DB) is a research studies online repository. Certified students, alumni, and professor are the only one who can access this website. Although it is a limited access website, We, the research db team committed our selves for there hard-long-created research to not just be available to the entire campus but also to present it with a bang! ＼\٩( 'ω' )و //／
